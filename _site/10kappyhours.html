<p>Yup, you heard it right. If you attend 10 Kappy Hours (or eligible events), you get the very cool “Korean Bae” T-Shirt. It was designed by us, and we will be selling it for $40.</p>

<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>The first eligible event is the 2022 Holiday Party in December 2022. All prior events do not count towards the free t-shirt.</li>
  <li>You must mark your attendance with a KAPS officer at the event, otherwise we won’t know that you came. They must put your attendance into the free t-shirt spreadsheet.</li>
  <li>Before your 10th Kappy Hour, please tell us your t-shirt size so we can have one custom made.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-is-a-kappy-hour">What is a Kappy Hour?</h3>
<p>We hold a happy hour (KAPpy Hour) on the 3rd week of almost every month. It is our flagship event series, and is a great place to meet new friends or catch up with old ones. Bring your friends, including any non-Korean friends. It is usually held at a bar at around 5pm on a Friday. We try to move it around including the city, South Bay, and East Bay.</p>
