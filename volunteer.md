## Volunteer Roles
We are excited about the next year. We are rapidly expanding KAPS since people are now more comfortable with meeting IRL. Join at this exciting moment!

The benefits of volunteering are 1) being part of an intimate community, 2) expanding your leadership skills, and 3) going to the annual KAPS leadership Lake Tahoe retreat!

There are over 20 roles. [Express interest here](https://kaps.org/volunteer-interest).

### IRL Roles

These roles do not have a minimum commitment.

**Kappy Hour greeter**
You should think of yourself as the host of the Kappy Hour. You will introduce yourself to everyone at the Kappy Hour. You will get to know their backgrounds and stories. And you will help to connect people with others that they might want to get to know. It helps to be good with names and faces. It helps to be outgoing.
