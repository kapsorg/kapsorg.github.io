<p>You can be a photographer or greeter for a single event, and there are no additional expectations beyond that.</p>

<p><strong>Photographer</strong>
Take photos at our events, including the Kappy Hours and our flagship events. You do not need to pay for certain events such as the Bonfire ($40 value). And an officer will buy you a drink at every Kappy Hour where you take photos.</p>

<p><strong>Kappy Hour greeter</strong>
You should think of yourself as the host of the Kappy Hour. You will introduce yourself to everyone at the Kappy Hour. You will get to know their backgrounds and stories. And you will help to connect people with others that they might want to get to know. It helps to be good with names and faces. It helps to be outgoing.</p>
