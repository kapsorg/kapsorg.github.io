## Sponsorship
We offer sponsorship opportunities to brands and businesses who want to advertise to our membership. For more details, contact us at kapso@kaps.org.

Sponsorship is great for real estate agents and brokers, mortgage brokers, insurance agents, financial planners, personal lawyers, accountants, beverage brands, local restaurants and shops. Note that we only accept sponsorship from reputable businesses and brands. 

We offer the following ways of advertising your business:
- We can make engaging Instagram and Facebook stories. Some of those stories may include amateur acting by KAPS members! Such stories may be skits that feature you and your product or service. Using our members is a fun and engaging way to tell your message.

- You can sponsor specific events, in which we will include your logo and short information on all our marketing for that event.

- If you sponsor a volunteer day, or a sports event like a race, we can brand our whole event with your business. For example, the volunteer day would be called "KAPS Volunteers sponsored by John Lee, Coldwell Banker". We would make t-shirts with your logo and business entirely covering the back of the shirt. We would take a group photo of all the KAPS attendees with your t-shirt. And also photos of KAPS members doing the volunteer work with your t-shirt. We do not grant you permission to use those photos, unless people in those photos sign a release directly with your business. We would feature those photos on our website, with a description of your business. 

Sponsorship rates are based on the specific advertisement and the extent of our reach at the time of the deal. Currently, we are offering advertising starting at $500. Please reach out to kapso@kaps.org to discuss more.
